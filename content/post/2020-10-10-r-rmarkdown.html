<h3>1.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>There are a number of forecasting packages written in R to choose from, each with their own pros and cons.</p>
<p>For almost a decade, the <code>forecast</code> library from the <code>fpp2</code> forecasting framework has been a major force in the time series world. However, within the last year or so an official update has been released. This new <code>fpp3</code> framework utilizes a package called <code>fable</code> that follows tidy methodology as opposed to using base R code.</p>
<p>More recently, the <code>modeltime</code> library has been released and this also follows tidy methods. It has a companion package <code>timetk</code> for data manipulation and visualization which is also written by the same author.</p>
<p>The following is a code comparison of various time series visualizations between these frameworks: <code>fpp2</code>, <code>fpp3</code> and <code>timetk/modeltime</code>.</p>
<p>Before we start, keep a few things in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the essential code has been provided</li>
<li>Non-essential code such as plot titles and themes has been excluded</li>
<li>All plots utilize the Business Science ggplot theme</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also embed plots. See Figure <a href="#fig:pie">1</a> for example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c(&#39;Sky&#39;, &#39;Sunny side of pyramid&#39;, &#39;Shady side of pyramid&#39;),
  col = c(&#39;#0292D8&#39;, &#39;#F7EA39&#39;, &#39;#C4B632&#39;),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)</code></pre>
